## Brief
This is a simple web scraper that scrapes course data for all University of Toronto campuses. It also scrapes other important data, such as divisional and reference data.

## Usage
You can either:
1. Run the `main.py` file located inside the project
2. Import `CourseScraper.py` into your own file and run its `scrape()` method. This isn't recommended/required in most cases since the scraper doesn't return data or provide any updates aside from terminal outputs

## Source
The scraper collects all it's data from [https://ttb.utoronto.ca/](https://ttb.utoronto.ca/)
